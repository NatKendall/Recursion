# Recursion

This is a fairly recent program I had to create for my data structures course. During this section we focues on using recursion with and without a helper.

What the program does:
- For this program the first method finds the number of upper case letter in a string returning the count.
- The second method uses a helper method to count the number of upper case letters in an array and return the count. 
- The print statements were all inside the main method.
